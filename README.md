INTRODUCTION
The Titanic dataset contains passenger information from the 1912 Titanic ship disaster. This project analyzes survival patterns using Python and the Pandas library.

TITANIC DATASET
The dataset includes details such as PassengerId, Name, Age, Gender, Class, Fare, and Survival status. It helps in understanding how different factors influenced passenger survival.

METHODOLOGY
The dataset was imported using Pandas and cleaned by handling missing values. Data analysis techniques such as filtering, sorting, grouping, and aggregation were applied.

STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Statistical functions like mean, sum, and groupby() were used to analyze survival rates based on gender, class, age, and fare. Patterns affecting survival were identified through descriptive analysis.

CONCLUSION
The analysis shows that gender, passenger class, and fare significantly influenced survival chances. Female and first-class passengers had higher survival rates compared to others.
